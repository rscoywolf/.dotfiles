# Neovim Config

This config has a decent amount of work and is very close to a proper IDE.  Why didn't I use [LunarVim](https://github.com/LunarVim/LunarVim), [NvChad](https://github.com/NvChad/NvChad) or [SpaceVim](https://github.com/liuchengxu/space-vim)?  I like doing things myself.

> ℹ️ &nbsp; I try to keep all of the key bindings in [this file](https://github.com/AlexvZyl/.dotfiles/blob/main/.config/nvim/lua/alex/key-bindings.lua).
